# AoC Cyxo - Functional Ruby one-liners

The idea is to solve the AoC using functional Ruby (not necessarily one-liners, but the shorter the code, the funnier).

### Note :

> The input is read from the standard input (not a file).

If you want to use the file, you can run the program as such:

```bash
cat input.txt | ruby part1.rb
```
